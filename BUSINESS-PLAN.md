# UAT-as-a-Service for Vibe Coders

**Date:** 2026-02-11  
**Origin:** sinnseared.com audit — 50% checkout failure rate that real user testing would have caught instantly

---

## The Problem

Vibe coders (Cursor/Bolt/v0/Replit devs) ship fast but:
- Don't have QA teams
- Don't do real user testing
- Ship bugs that cost them customers (like cart IDs breaking checkout)
- Can't afford $10K+ enterprise QA tools
- Don't have time to recruit testers

**Result:** Products that *look* done but break when real users try them.

---

## The Product

**On-demand UAT testing for indie builders and small teams.**

### How it works:
1. Submit your URL + brief ("test checkout flow")
2. Real humans test within 24-48 hours
3. Get video recordings + bug reports + UX feedback
4. Flat rate pricing ($50-200 per test cycle)

### Positioning:
- "QA team in your pocket"
- "Ship with confidence"
- "Find the bugs before your users do"

---

## Target Customers

1. **Vibe coders** — Cursor/Bolt/v0 builders shipping MVPs
2. **Indie hackers** — Solo founders without QA budget
3. **Small agencies** — Need to QA client work before handoff
4. **No-code builders** — Bubble/Webflow/Framer sites

---

## Pricing Ideas

| Tier | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Quick Check | $49 | 3 testers, 1 flow, 24h turnaround |
| Full Flow | $149 | 5 testers, full user journey, video recordings |
| Launch Ready | $299 | 10 testers, mobile + desktop, regression after fixes |

---

## Tester Pool

Two options:
1. **Crowdsourced** — UserTesting.com model, pay testers per test
2. **Curated community** — Recruit reliable testers, pay monthly retainer

Could start with option 1 (UserTesting API or similar), graduate to option 2 for quality.

## MVP Features

- [ ] Submit URL + test instructions
- [ ] Match with available testers
- [ ] Screen recording (Loom or similar)
- [ ] Bug report template (steps to reproduce, severity, screenshot)
- [ ] Dashboard to view results
- [ ] Slack/Discord notifications

---

## Competition

- **UserTesting.com** — Enterprise, expensive ($49/video minimum)
- **Userlytics** — Similar, not indie-friendly
- **TryMyUI** — Okay pricing but clunky
- **PlaybookUX** — Good but still $100+/test

**Gap:** No one is targeting vibe coders specifically with fast, cheap, opinionated testing.

## Name Ideas

- TestMyVibe
- ShipCheck
- VibeQA
- LaunchTest
- RealUserTest
- CheckBeforeShip

## Next Steps

1. Validate demand — post in indie hacker communities
2. MVP — Google Form intake → manual tester matching → Loom videos
3. Charge from day 1 — $49/test to validate willingness to pay
4. Automate once we have 10+ paying customers

This is a standalone business — not tied to any other ventures.
